# LoadingAnimation

## What is it?
LoadingAnimation is a simple .NET's WinForms control displaying an Ajax-like loading animation. You can set animation speed and pause the animation.
Internally using an 32bpp ARGB PNG, the control is fully transparent, so you can place it on any surface while still looking good, without any annoying 
white borders often encountered among GIF's using 1-bit transparency.

The control's features are VERY VERY basic, if you want more, feel free to fork and extend :).
